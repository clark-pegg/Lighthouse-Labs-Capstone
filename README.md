# Lighthouse Labs Capstone Project

## Overview
A PDF copy of my capstone project report for the Lighthouse Labs cyber security program.

## Skills Displayed
This project has two main areas of focus: incident response and security recommendation generation.
For the incident response portion I had to analyze logs provided and identify if there was an attack, how the attack was performed, and use all of this to generate recommendations.
The security recommendations generated primarily have to do with device management: authentication, zero-trust, and seperation of duties.
Specific recommendations are also provided for better securing a webserver.
